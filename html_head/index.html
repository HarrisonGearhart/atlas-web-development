    <H2>Hobbies</H2>
    <p>In my free time I enjoy playing golf and pickleball, spending time with family, and watching sports/movies.</p>
    
    <H2>Pets</H2>
    <p>I don't have any pets anymore, but I used to have a black pit/retriever mix named Sonny. I still miss him very much.</p>
    
    <H2>Why I Chose Atlas</H2>
    <p>I chose Atlas because I felt like I had the best chance to get my coding career started through their program. I enjoy the peer collaboration, in person help opportunities, and our career services resources.</p>
    
    <H2>What I want to do with my FS knowledge</H2>
    <p>I would like to start out with a company, and maybe start doing freelance on the side.</p>

    <H2>Fun Facts About Me!</H2>
    <p>I won a conference championship as a player and as a Head Coach for Broken Arrow High School. I'm a diehard OU fan but I was born in Stillwater. I can also juggle.</p>
